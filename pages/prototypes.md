## Updates on the project : development of our prototypes

In order to solve certain shortcomings of previously developed COVID-boxes, our team has been working on several prototypes. Our main goals are to improve the aerosols removal efficiency, the box ergonomy for tracheal intubation, and the manufacturing easiness regarding time efficiency and material availability. We first conducted a comprehensive literature review of publications and preprints concerning COVID-boxes, which is available to you through [our zotero database](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499567/aerosolbox-public/library). We have prepared a first draft of a short review that synthesizes the content of this bibliography, you can read it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aWn8YKI-uvnVGg00FcT8AjDxAxyuqD3D3u4QniGg_g/edit?usp=sharing) and can even add comments! 

Based on the literature review, we are currently working on four different box designs: 

* Classic cube box
* Tunnel shape box
* Dome shape box
* Tent box

## Four different intubation box prototypes explored

All the prototypes are still in the testing phase and we expect that changes and modification will be made once we receive feedbacks from doctors.
