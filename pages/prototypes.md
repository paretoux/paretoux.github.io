In order to solve certain shortcomings of previously developed COVID-boxes, our team has been working on several prototypes. Our main goals are to improve the **aerosols removal efficiency**, the **box ergonomy** for tracheal intubation, and the **manufacturing easiness** regarding time efficiency and material availability. We first conducted a comprehensive literature review of publications and preprints concerning COVID-boxes, which is available to you through [our zotero database](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499567/aerosolbox-public/library). We have prepared a first draft of a short review that synthesizes the content of this bibliography, you can read it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aWn8YKI-uvnVGg00FcT8AjDxAxyuqD3D3u4QniGg_g/edit?usp=sharing) and can even add comments! 

Based on the literature review, we are currently working on four different box designs: 

* Classic cube box
* Tunnel shape box
* Dome shape box
* Tent box

All the prototypes are still in the testing phase and we expect that changes and modification will be made once we receive feedbacks from doctors.

In addition, the **particle capture efficiency** of the different box designs is estimated. To evaluate the airflow through the box models, the **simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics** was used by our team. Many variables can be modified to optimize the airflow inside the intubation box and thus the capture of the viral particles in a fixed time slot. Rounder corners, smaller box volume, higher flowrate, positionnement of the aspiration unit, etc. are tricks than can be used to capture faster and in greater numbers the particles circulating inside the box. 

Of course these simulations are all approximations. By comparing different models using always the same boundery conditions our team was able to have a fairly good estimation of which box models present the most efficient particle capture. The respective simulations will be presented within each prototype page below.
