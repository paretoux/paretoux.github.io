## Updates on the project : development of our prototypes

In order to solve certain shortcomings of covid-boxes currently being produced, our team has been working on several prototypes of intubation boxes. Our main guidelines while thinking and designing the prototypes were mainly aimed at improving the ventilation of the box (efficient capture of viral particles), the ergonomy for the doctors maneuverability inside the box, and ease of manufacturing (rapidity and availability). We have first tried to gather as many publications and preprints as possible that appeared to be relevant when it comes to covid-boxes. This literature review is available to you and can be accessed through 
[our zotero database.](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499567/aerosolbox-public/library)
We have prepared a first draft of a short review that synthesizes the content of this bibliography, you can read it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aWn8YKI-uvnVGg00FcT8AjDxAxyuqD3D3u4QniGg_g/edit?usp=sharing) and can even add comments!
This review is directed toward four different kinds of box designs that are presented here. Each model showcase their own advantages.

## Four different intubation box models explored

* Classic box	
* Tunnel shape
* Dome model
* Tent model

The tente model is still at the early stages of conception and will need more refinement before it is presented. The concept for this model is to have, instead of rigid plastic sheets, a flexible plastic film that makes up the whole “box”. The main advantages of this model are its lightweightness and the possibility to fold it or to deploy it with almost no effort needed by the doctors. It still poses certain challenges concerning the connexions for tubing and the arm entries since the structure is quite loose. The idea with this model would be to have a frame of poles in PVC tubing that support a plastic film. The poles will be drilled with holes connected to the vacuum which would also act as a ventilation mean.

For all models, sealing at the torso of the patient is planned to be achieved with an impermeable plastic film within which an elastic band would be included. The elastic, sewn into the plastic film on both ends, allows the latest to be secured to the prototype and to mold the patient’s torso thus limiting the gaps and improving the seal. The gap at the patient’s torso is the only unsealed region on the prototypes and it is from this gap that the outside air enters the box and is sucked in by the vacuum ports. For the tunnel model, a sealing at the head is also achieved with a plastic film.

test

As for access to the patient different approaches are being studied. The preferred one up until now is that of an extruded circular hole in the plastic sheet. This outgrow has a diameter matching that of a glove’s long sleeve. The sleeve is sealed on the plastic cylinder with a hose clamp. The inside of the box is completely isolated from the doctors hands which enter the box via the glove. The sleeve of the gloves being very long, the mobility of the doctors in the box is not diminished. In the event that the access needs to be made through a plastic film (i.e. tent model) then the same kind of glove is fused on the film (plastic to plastic). 

All the prototypes are still in the testing phase and we predict that changes and modification will need to be made once we receive feedback from doctors and advance further into the development phases. Updates will be added when new iterations of the prototypes are made, and as some ideas are discarded or new ones are adopted.
