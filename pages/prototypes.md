## Updates on the project : development of our prototypes

In order to solve certain shortcomings of covid-boxes currently being produced, our team has been working on several prototypes of intubation boxes. Our main guidelines while thinking and designing the prototypes were mainly aimed at improving the ventilation of the box (efficient capture of viral particles), the ergonomy for the doctors maneuverability inside the box, and ease of manufacturing (rapidity and availability). We have first tried to gather as many publications and preprints as possible that appeared to be relevant when it comes to covid-boxes. This literature review is available to you and can be accessed through 
[our zotero database.](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2499567/aerosolbox-public/library)
We have prepared a first draft of a short review that synthesizes the content of this bibliography, you can read it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aWn8YKI-uvnVGg00FcT8AjDxAxyuqD3D3u4QniGg_g/edit?usp=sharing) and can even add comments!
This review is directed toward four different kinds of box designs that are presented here. Each model showcase their own advantages.
