**Tracheal intubation** is one of the **highest-risk moments for COVID-19 transmission** to healthcare workers and other patients. The virus transmission can occur via droplets directly expelled from one respiratory system to another. Infection can also occur via airborne transmission where droplet nuclei float in the surrounding air before being breathed in. The current strategy in Canadian hospitals to minimise the risk to healthcare workers during these procedures is to shield the workers from droplets and aerosols by having them wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Unluckily, the health sector is experiencing PPE shortages. Moreover, removing the personal equipement also poses a risk of infection if not done properly. More recently (Feb/March 2020), **"aerosol boxes"** started being manufactured (sometimes at home!) and used by anesthesiologist world-wide to minimize aerosol spread during tracheal intubation and extubation. PPE is still to be worn when using the aerosol box since the box minimizes but doesn't eliminate the risk of infection from the COVID patients.

Our project aims to design a **novel aerosol box model** which can act as a **replacement for PPE**. For this to be feasible, the box model will need to garanty aerosol containement. We are collaborating with HÃ´pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont to ensure that our model will be well suited for hospital environnment, and that it will be practical, and easy of use for the doctors performing the procedures.
