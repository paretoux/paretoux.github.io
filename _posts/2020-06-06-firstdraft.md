Our team has been working on a review of the different tracheal intubation aerosol box designs that have been made public since Dr. Hsien Yung Lai’s design, assessing the latest features and newest ideas. New box models are being developed and launched in hospitals at a very fast rate, showcasing innovative ways to improve the product.  This state-of-the-art, which we have been working on during the last few weeks, aims to lay a solid foundation for our project. The objective is to take off where the latest improvements leave us, so we can come up with a design that will bring something new to the table. We seek not to replace but to better. Working in collaboration with doctors from Hospital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, we want to propose to them an aerosol box that meets all their needs. A cornerstone of our aerosol box is that it could act as a personal protective equipment (PPE) for the doctors. This will help fight the shortage of PPE experienced by the health sector. 

You will find in the review an overlook on the current aerosol box models. Following this research, the limitations that remain are enumerated and we will seek to overcome them with a new box model. In the end we have targeted three main features that will guide our design. The enhanced ergonomics of the box, the better containment of the aerosol inside the box, and the careful choice of the box’s material. These aspects are reflected upon, as we seek to design an optimal aerosol box.
