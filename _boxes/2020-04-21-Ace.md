Effectiveness :
* Effectively contained smoke, fluorescein aerosol, and sodium saccharin aerosol within the enclosure during use
* Able to maintain negative pressure during simulated Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP)


Design features :
* Four-sided acrylic frame
* Silicone gaskets on the arm ports
* Slanted roof to provide optimal visualization and space for intubation
* Two arm ports for the primary airway operator, and two for an airway assistant 
* Connections to the patient including monitor cables, intravenous lines, and oxygen tubing may be either run under the plastic sheet or under the enclosure
* Two wall suction units  (connected to standard hospital roomâ€™s in-wall vacuum suction source)
* Negative pressure (between -98 and -343 Pa)
* The caudal end of the box was enclosed using high-density polyethylene (HPDE) plastic sheeting


Drawbacks :
* Made out of acrylic, wich will easily shattter after an impact
* Armports are not perfectly sealed 
* Square shape and sharp cornerergonomic
