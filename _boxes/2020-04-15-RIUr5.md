Design features :
* Self-Seal using physiotherapy resistance band
* Slanted Top for better view (65°)
* Extra hole for assistant
* Seals can come apart at the end to increase washability.
* Viral filter port (for a “standard filter”, need to find this dimension if necessary)

Drawbacks :
* No aerosol containment 
* Removing the elastic band seems difficult, could be easier and disposable.
