Design features :
* Polycarbonate (PC) shield
Base sits around the patient with slots on either side
* A polycarbonate bendable sheet that acts as the shield, with ‘feet’ that slot into the openings in the base
* Domed side supports that provide stability to the main sheet
* Four iris port sleeves for the surgeon’s arms to fit through
* Four rings that connect these sleeves to the shield.
* Two  low fluid cloth drapes are attached to either end of the shield to complete the enclosure around the
patient
* Its ‘flat-pack’ design facilitates simple assembly, transportation and storage



Drawbacks :
*  Shield still needs to be used with PEE, not 100% containment
* Armhole position not best adapted to intubation procedure
