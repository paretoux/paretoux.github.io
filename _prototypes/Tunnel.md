The tunnel model also incorporates the concept of the semi-permanent base attached to the bed - allowing quick and easy removal of the top part of the assembly and giving direct access to the patient. The great advantage of this model is that it can be shaped from a flat PVC sheet into a tunnel in no time, directly in the intervention room. The flat sheet can be bent on the spot and locked into the base with the same mechanism as the classic box prototype. Disinfection of this model appears to be the easiest as well as its manufacturing since it is just one flat PVC sheet. Since there are no sharp corners at all, we hope that ventilation efficiency will also be improved for this shape. The aspiration unit is placed on the top of the curve vis-a-vis the patientâ€™s respiratory exits. Both ends, front and back panel, will be closed off with a plastic film. For access to the patient, plastic gloves with long sleeves will be melted onto hole cut outs for a perfect seal.
