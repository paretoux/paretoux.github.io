The tent box is still at the early stages of conception and will need more refinement before it is presented. The concept for this prototype is to have, instead of rigid plastic sheets, a flexible plastic film that makes up the whole “box”. The main advantages of this box are its lightweightness and the possibility to fold it or to deploy it with almost no effort needed by the doctors. It still poses certain challenges concerning the connections for tubing and the arm entries since the structure is quite loose. The idea with this box would be to have a frame of poles in PVC tubing that support a plastic film. The poles will be drilled with holes to connect to the vacuum source to ventilate out the aerosols.
