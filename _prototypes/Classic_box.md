The classic box is the most common model of the covid-box and the most similar to the original Hsien box design https://paretoux.github.io/boxes/2020-03-22-HsienBox.html. It can easily be manufactured by folding and/or cutting flat transparent plastic sheets and assembling them into a cube. The flat panels make it easy to cut holes for port entries and arm entries guaranteeing access to the patient. The square base mimics the shape of the hospital beds. We are currently closely following the work of Santé Libre. Their box was developed in collaboration with doctors from hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont. The dimensions of width and height of the box, the location of the arm ports and vacuum port, the angle of the front panel, etc. have all been modified following the feedback of the doctors who have tested numerous iterations of the prototype. We have been using their latest CAD model (see picture) to design a slightly different version of their box. The major problem with the cube is the recirculation zones of the airflow that form inside via the sharp corners. This creates local turbulences and impairs viral particle capture. To counter this, our model incorporates an octopus ventilation system. The main aspiration unit is extended with a manifold into 5 aspiration units; one for each top corner of the box and the last one via the patient's mouth on the top of the box. We also included a base that can be placed semi-permanently on a bed. All connexions for tubing needed during the intubation procedure (for the oxygen mask, the endotracheal tube, etc.) are made through the base. The box can be quickly attached to the base with a slide and lock system. The base is designed with hooks and straps so it can be secured to the bed from underneath it. In this manner,  if need be, the box alone can be  quickly removed allowing the doctor immediate access to the patient; the base and all the connexions will remain on the bed with no obstructions for the medical workers around the box.
