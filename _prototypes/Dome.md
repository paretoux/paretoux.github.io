The dome shape box seems to be the most interesting for an optimized ventilation. This can be asserted based on airflow simulations made by Asher Amos Benchimol, student of Pr. Vidal. He has shared with us different particle capture efficiencies for different box shapes and the dome proved to be the best. This prototype is still being evaluated regarding its visibility qualities. A prototype has been shared with doctors at h√¥pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont. If approved the prototype will be further concretised.

## Particle capture efficiency simulation

The dome model is the absolute best shape that can be given to the intubation box for the elimination of the viral particles. The curve of the outer walls guide the particles straight into the aspiration unit. The dome shape also has a smaller volume of air inside, which accelerates the flowrate and makes the elimination of the particles inside the box faster. It is the optimal choice for the intubation box if we take the ventilation as sole criteria.
