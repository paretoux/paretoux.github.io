The dome model seems to be the most interesting for an optimized ventilation. This can be asserted based on airflow simulations made  by Asher Amos Benchimol, student of Pr. Vidal. He has shared with us different particle capture efficiencies for different box shapes and the dome proved to be the best. This model is still being evaluated regarding its visibility qualities. A prototype has been shared with doctors at h√¥pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont. If approved the model will be further concretised.
