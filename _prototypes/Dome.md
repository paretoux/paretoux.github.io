The dome shape box seems to be the most interesting for an optimized ventilation. This can be asserted based on airflow simulations made by Asher Amos Benchimol, student of Pr. Vidal. He has shared with us different particle capture efficiencies for different box shapes and the dome proved to be the best. This prototype is still being evaluated regarding its visibility qualities. A prototype has been shared with doctors at h√¥pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont. If approved the prototype will be further concretised.
